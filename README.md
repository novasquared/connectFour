# Connect Four Game

Simple Connect Four game written in javascript

Connect Four is played on a grid, 7 wide by 6 deep, with two players, 1 (red) and 2 (blue). The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the furthest-down unoccupied slot.

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, when a player clicks the top 
of a column, a piece is dropped until a player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, 
vert, or diag) or until the board fills (tie).
